# PDF-Malware-Detection-Using-Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based malware detection system to classify PDF files as malicious or benign. The dataset includes various structural and content-based features from PDFs, such as the presence of JavaScript, number of pages, file size, and obsolete elements. The goal of the project is to identify patterns that differentiate malicious PDF files from benign ones.\

**Project Overview**
This project builds a classification model that identifies whether a given PDF file is malicious or benign based on a set of features extracted from the PDF metadata. The Random Forest Classifier is used to predict the class of each PDF, after performing data preprocessing and feature engineering.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains several key features extracted from PDF files, including:

 Structural information like the number of objects and streams.
 
 Presence of JavaScript code.
 
 Metadata like file size and number of pages.
 
 **File: Evasive-PDF-Samples.csv**
 
 The dataset contains several features to aid in determining whether a file is malware.

**Features**

The following features are used in the analysis and classification:

pdfsize: Size of the PDF file in KB.

pages: Number of pages in the document.

JS: Presence of JavaScript embedded in the PDF.

OBS_JS: Presence of obsolete JavaScript elements.

Acroform: Presence of interactive forms in the PDF.

ObjStm: Presence of Object Streams.

Additional features like the number of objects (obj), streams, and the location of cross-reference tables.

**Data Preprocessing**

Handling Missing Data: Missing values in several columns (e.g., JS, OBS_JS) were imputed using the mean strategy.

Feature Exploration: Visualizations like histograms and boxplots were used to understand the distribution of key features such as file size and number of pages.

**Feature Engineering**
Several domain-specific features were engineered to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy:

obj_to_endobj_ratio: Ratio of obj to endobj elements to capture structural complexity.

has_xref_table: Binary feature to indicate the presence of a cross-reference table.

has_javascript: Combined feature indicating the presence of JavaScript (from multiple fields).

has_suspicious_obsolete_elements: Combined feature that detects the presence of obsolete JavaScript or Acroform elements.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

**Feature Selection:**
Chi-square test and Random Forest feature importance were used to select the top features.

**Model:**
The model used for classification is the Random Forest Classifier, which was trained and evaluated on an 80%-20% train-test split.

**Metrics:**
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score were used to evaluate the model's performance.

**Model Evaluation Results:**

	Accuracy: 0.9995
 
	Precision: 0.9997
 
	Recall: 0.9998
 
	F1-Score: 0.9997

**Results**
The Random Forest model provided the following key results:
The top 5 most important features contributing to classification were identified using Random Forest feature importance.
The model achieved competitive precision and recall, which are particularly important for malware detection tasks where false positives and false negatives can have significant impacts.

# PDF-Malware-Detection-By-Machine Learning
✨Developed a malware detection system using a dataset of PDF files to identify malicious documents.

✨Conducted data preprocessing including handling missing values and outlier removal, feature engineering, and feature selection (Chi-Square, Random Forest importance).

✨Trained and evaluated a Random Forest model achieving a precision of X%, recall of Y%, and F1-score of Z%.

✨Implemented visualizations to understand data distribution and key patterns using Matplotlib.

✨Saved the trained model for future deployment using joblib and ensured the reproducibility of results.

✨**Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Random Forest Classifier, Keras (used for Model class).
